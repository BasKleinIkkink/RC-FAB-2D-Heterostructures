# How To Use
This folder contains all the documents needed to create documentation using Sphinx with
numpy style docstrings (using napoleon).

```bash
pip3 install sphinx
pip3 install fugro
```

## Updating/creating the docs
As this folder is only set up for building html docs use the following line to update.

```bash
make html
```

The files will be put in the build folder under the type that was created.
