Welcome to Stacking setup's documentation!
==========================================

**Stacking setup** is a python library that is used to control custom stacking setups for stacking 2D materials. The library consists of 3 parts: The backend, frondend, and middleware. 
All of the hardware control takes place in the backend components, all interactions with the user (except for CLI) takes place in the frontend components, the middleware connects the frond and backend.
