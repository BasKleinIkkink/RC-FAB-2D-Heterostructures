Welcome to the stacking setup documentation. This document will guide you
through the process of setting up a new stacking environment. This documentation
assumes that all the needed hardware is present and the user has a working knowlege
of the following subjects:

Programming subjects
--------------------

.. warning::
    The library was developed with modularity and flexibility in mind. While this means
    that adding functionality is relativly easy it does not mean that no programming
    knowledge is required. It is highly recommended to at least have a grasp of the 
    topics below to avoid frustration and unpredictable behavior of the instrument.

* Python:
    * Virtual environment on the userd operating system
    * `Threading <https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html>`_
    * `Multiprocessing <https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html>`_
    * `Class inheritance <https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_inheritance.asp>`_
    * `Exception handling <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html>`_
    * `Logging <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html>`_
    * `Mocking and monkey patching <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html>`_
* Basic stamping process
