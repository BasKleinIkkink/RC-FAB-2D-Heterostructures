    Communication interface:
    ------------------------
    All TANGO controllers communicate via a serial COM port interface, independent
    of the controller type (RS232C, USB, PCI, PCI-E). The default setting is
    57600,8,2,N.

    Instruction syntax:
    -------------------
    The instructions and parameters are sent as cleartext ASCII strings with a
    terminating carriage return [CR], which is 0x0d hex. Characters may be upper-,
    lower- or camel-case. The parameters are separated by a space character.
    This provides easy access to all functions by using a simple terminal program
    such as HyperTerminal. A typical instruction syntax is as follows: 

    [!,?][instruction][SP][optional axis] [parameter1][SP][parameter2] [etcâ€¦] [CR]

    A read instruction may return more than one parameter. In many cases the number
    of returned parameters depends on the amount of available axes:

    [axis X] [if available: axis Y] [if available: axis Z] [if available: axis A]
