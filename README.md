# RC-FAB-2D-Heterostructures
This project involves setting up a home-made transfer set up with commercially obtained linear, rotational and goniometer stages and writing Python codes to automate motorized micromanipulators, and temperature controllers so that the linear stages can be remote-controlled, giving us the flexibility to operate the set-up in a reproducible manner without any physical proximity with the operator.

## Installation
This program is developed with Windows in mind, all functions will probably work on the general unix distro's but only windows 10 functionality is tested

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
For now only usage directly from code is possible
