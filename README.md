# RC-FAB-2D-Heterostructures
This project involves setting up a home-made transfer set up with commercially obtained linear, rotational and goniometer stages and writing Python codes to automate motorized micromanipulators, and temperature controllers so that the linear stages can be remote-controlled, giving us the flexibility to operate the set-up in a reproducible manner without any physical proximity with the operator.

For more information about the package see the docs repository.
