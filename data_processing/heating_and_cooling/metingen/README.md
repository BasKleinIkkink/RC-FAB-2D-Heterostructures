# MEASUREMENTS
This folder contains the measurements done on the sampleholder and spacer cylinder.

Three thermocouples were used and logged on a voltcraft pl-125-t4usb vs. 
The first is placed on top of the sample bed, the second on half the height of the spacer cylinder. The last thermocouple is used to monitor the spacer temperature and is placed under the mica layer.

# temp_data_solid_cylinder_temp_cycle.csv
This file contains temp measurements over multiple cycles between 23C (ambient) 
and 110C until equalibrium was reached. For this measurement the solid cylinder was used.

samplerate = 0.5 Hz

A cycle consists of heating from ambient to 110C, holding for 2 minutes to let the ripple 
even out, and back down to ambient.

# heat_dissipation.csv
This file contains the measurements of the heat dissipation in the reduced mass cylinder. 
The thermocouples are placed in the same position as in the temp_data_solid.... file. 
The cylinder was heated to 40C and then the measurement was started.

samplerate = 0.5 Hz

# temp_data_reduced_cylinder_temp_cycle.csv
Same thermal cycles as temp_data_solid_cylinder but with the reduced cylinder
