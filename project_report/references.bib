  abstract = {The design of vibration-sensitive advanced technology facilities generally involves considerable attention to structural and mechanical aspects. In most cases, the vibration control measures contribute significantly to a facility's cost. The selection of a vibration criterion for use in design is an important step in the design process. Many process equipment manufacturers have provided tool-specific criteria, and the literature contains several forms of "generic" criteria. Unfortunately, there is no standardization in either tool-specific or generic criteria, and considerable confusion can arise, often due to the forms of data representation used. This paper first reviews some of the relevant fundamentals of signal processing, then uses experimental data to develop a tool-specific vibration criterion for an optical microscope. Two dissimilar approaches to generic criteria are discussed, and their signal-processing requirements are examined. They are compared with a manufacturer's published vibration criteria for a projection aligner. Recommendations are given for future development of tool-specific criteria.},

Moreover, controlling the positioning of two-dimensional crystals facilitates their integration in complex devices, which enables the exploration of novel applications and the discovery of new phenomena in these materials. To date, deterministic transfer methods rely on the use of sacrificial polymer layers and wet chemistry to some extent. Here, we develop an all-dry transfer method that relies on viscoelastic stamps and does not employ any wet chemistry step. This is found to be very advantageous to freely suspend these materials as there are no capillary forces involved in the process. Moreover, the whole fabrication process is quick, efficient, clean and it can be performed with high yield.},

The advent of 2D materials has provided unprecedented opportunities for novel heterostructures in the form of van der Waals stacks, laterally stitched 2D layers and more complex layered and 3D architectures. This Primer provides an overview of state-of-the-art methodologies for producing such van der Waals heterostructures, focusing on the two fundamentally different strategies, top-down deterministic assembly and bottom-up synthesis. Successful techniques, advantages and limitations are discussed for both approaches. As important as the fabrication itself is the characterization of the resulting engineered materials, for which a range of analysis techniques covering structure, composition and emerging functionality are highlighted. Examples of the properties of artificial van der Waals structures include optoelectronics and plasmonics, twistronics and unique functionality arising from the generalization of van der Waals assembly from 2D to 3D crystalline components. Finally, current issues of reproducibility, limitations and opportunities for future breakthroughs in terms of enhanced homogeneity, interfacial purity, feature control and ultimately orders-of-magnitude increased complexity of van der Waals heterostructures are discussed.},

  abstract = {Electrons moving through a spatially periodic lattice potential develop a quantized energy spectrum consisting of discrete Bloch bands. In two dimensions, electrons moving through a magnetic field also develop a quantized energy spectrum, consisting of highly degenerate Landau energy levels. When subject to both a magnetic field and a periodic electrostatic potential, two-dimensional systems of electrons exhibit a self-similar recursive energy spectrum. Known as Hofstadter's butterfly, this complex spectrum results from an interplay between the characteristic lengths associated with the two quantizing fields, and is one of the first quantum fractals discovered in physics. In the decades since its prediction, experimental attempts to study this effect have been limited by difficulties in reconciling the two length scales. Typical atomic lattices (with periodicities of less than one nanometre) require unfeasibly large magnetic fields to reach the commensurability condition, and in artificially engineered structures (with periodicities greater than about 100 nanometres) the corresponding fields are too small to overcome disorder completely. Here we demonstrate that moiré superlattices arising in bilayer graphene coupled to hexagonal boron nitride provide a periodic modulation with ideal length scales of the order of ten nanometres, enabling unprecedented experimental access to the fractal spectrum. We confirm that quantum Hall features associated with the fractal gaps are described by two integer topological quantum numbers, and report evidence of their recursive structure. Observation of a Hofstadter spectrum in bilayer graphene means that it is possible to investigate emergent behaviour within a fractal energy landscape in a system with tunable internal degrees of freedom.},

These systems are typically based on over pressurized N2 of Ar gloveboxes that require the use of very thick gloves to operate within the chamber or the implementation of several motorized micro-manipulators. Here, we set up a deterministic transfer system for 2D materials within a gloveless anaerobic chamber. Unlike other setups based on over-pressurized gloveboxes, in our system the operator can manipulate the 2D materials within the chamber with bare hands. This experimental setup allows us to exfoliate 2D materials and to deterministically place them at a desired location with accuracy in a controlled O2-free and very low humidity ({$<$}2\% RH) atmosphere. We illustrate the potential of this system to work with air-sensitive 2D materials by comparing the stability of black phosphorus and perovskite flakes inside and outside the anaerobic chamber.},

The paper also discusses the need to develop methods and standards for measuring the vibration sensitivity of equipment. Some examples are given which illustrate the considerable confusion in equipment sensitivity standards that exists at the present time. A plea is made to equipment manufacturers and users to develop and call for, respectively, specifications that are real and precise. This is especially important as the high- technology community enters the ''age of the nanometer.''},

  abstract = {Transfer functions for geophone and accelerometer transducers are derived. The mechanical deflection within the sensor and how that deflection is transformed into an electrical signal are both important in the derivation of transfer functions. For both transducers the output to the digitizer is the double time derivative of the ground displacement. Due to interactions of the mechanical system and the transducer, a geophone transducer reduces amplitude and adds phase lag to low frequencies. Wavelets calculated from the amplitude and phase spectra of the transducer transfer functions are shown. Next an input zero-phase wavelet is examined to find the differences resulting from its transformation by the transducers. Accelerometer transducers are found to produce negligible changes to the waveform, and the ground motion can be recovered through a double integration.},

  abstract = {Mechanical exfoliation has been a key enabler of the exploration of the properties of two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, by providing routine access to high-quality material. The original exfoliation method, which remained largely unchanged during the past decade, provides relatively small flakes with moderate yield. Here, we report a modified approach for exfoliating thin monolayer and few-layer flakes from layered crystals. Our method introduces two process steps that enhance and homogenize the adhesion force between the outermost sheet in contact with a substrate: Prior to exfoliation, ambient adsorbates are effectively removed from the substrate by oxygen plasma cleaning, and an additional heat treatment maximizes the uniform contact area at the interface between the source crystal and the substrate. For graphene exfoliation, these simple process steps increased the yield and the area of the transferred flakes by more than 50 times compared to the established exfoliation methods. Raman and AFM characterization shows that the graphene flakes are of similar high quality as those obtained in previous reports. Graphene field-effect devices were fabricated and measured with back-gating and solution top-gating, yielding mobilities of ∼4000 and 12\,000 cm2/(V s), respectively, and thus demonstrating excellent electrical properties. Experiments with other layered crystals, e.g., a bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) superconductor, show enhancements in exfoliation yield and flake area similar to those for graphene, suggesting that our modified exfoliation method provides an effective way for producing large area, high-quality flakes of a wide range of 2D materials.},

Our ability to synthesize and study these 2D materials down to a single layer and to stack them to form van der Waals heterostructures opens up a wide range of possibilities from fundamental studies of nanoscale effects to future electronic and optoelectronic applications. Bottom-up and top-down synthesis and basic electronic properties of 2D chalcogenide materials have been covered in great detail elsewhere. Here, we bring attention to more subtle effects: how the environmental, surface, and crystal defects modify the electronic band structure and transport properties of 2D chalcogenide nanomaterials. Surface effects such as surface oxidation and substrate influence may dominate the overall transport properties, particularly in single layer chalcogenide devices. Thus, understanding such effects is critical for successful applications based on these materials. In this review, we discuss two classes of chalcogenides – Bi-based and Mo-based chalcogenides. The first are topological insulators with unique surface electronic properties and the second are promising for flexible optoelectronic applications as well as hydrogen evolution catalytic reactions.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper we present our latest developments in high precision positioning and handling systems operating inside Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM). This work is motivated by the growing need of new instruments for the in-situ analysis of materials. In the medium terms, these instruments will permit more laboratories to accomplish complex and repetitive tests on several samples and with various tools, without the need to open the SME chamber, increasing thus productivity and improving the reliability of the analysis. The concept of a complete manipulator system, working inside a SEM chamber (Lab-In-SEM: LIS) is proposed. Then the performances of a miniature-indenter -scratch(Miniatureindenter-scratch for SEM chamber: MISS) are described and compared with the commercial instrument MTS-XP. Examples of nano-indentation and scratch operations will be described. Then we present a five degrees-of-freedom manipulator (Ztilt-5). The Ztilt-5 has a resolution of 100nm, a workspace of several cubic centimeters and can lift weight up to 300 g. Its geometrical model has been implemented on a PC-based controller allowing telemanipulation, and joint or task spaces control. The Ztilt-5 is powered with a new type of piezo-actuators.},

  abstract = {Air quality transcends all scales with in the atmosphere from the local to the global with handovers and feedbacks at each scale interaction. Air quality has manifold effects on health, ecosystems, heritage and climate. In this review the state of scientific understanding in relation to global and regional air quality is outlined. The review discusses air quality, in terms of emissions, processing and transport of trace gases and aerosols. New insights into the characterization of both natural and anthropogenic emissions are reviewed looking at both natural (e.g. dust and lightning) as well as plant emissions. Trends in anthropogenic emissions both by region and globally are discussed as well as biomass burning emissions. In terms of chemical processing the major air quality elements of ozone, non-methane hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and aerosols are covered. A number of topics are presented as a way of integrating the process view into the atmospheric context; these include the atmospheric oxidation efficiency, halogen and HOx chemistry, nighttime chemistry, tropical chemistry, heat waves, megacities, biomass burning and the regional hot spot of the Mediterranean. New findings with respect to the transport of pollutants across the scales are discussed, in particular the move to quantify the impact of long-range transport on regional air quality. Gaps and research questions that remain intractable are identified. The review concludes with a focus of research and policy questions for the coming decade. In particular, the policy challenges for concerted air quality and climate change policy (co-benefit) are discussed.},

To obtain maximum performance in terms of mechanical strength, experimental studies were conducted considering the thermal process parameters such as nozzle and chamber temperatures. These optimal process settings and carefully controlled heating conditions, incorporated with post-processing of additional heat treatment, could provide a high degree of crystallinity and high tensile strength (i.e., more than 90\% compared to original material properties). To demonstrate the feasibility of industrial applications, we fabricated and tested several product prototypes, such as a wafer jig, a lathe chuck part, and plastic injection molds, all of which confirmed the excellent performance of PEEK for chemical resistance, high strength, and heat resistance, respectively.},

A core problem in the fabrication of these structures is the formation of clean interfaces between the individual two-dimensional materials which would affect device performance. We present here a technique for the rapid batch fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures, demonstrated by the controlled production of 22 mono-, bi- and trilayer graphene stacks encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride with close to 100\% yield. For the monolayer devices, we found semiclassical mean-free paths up to 0.9\,μm, with the narrowest samples showing clear indications of the transport being affected by boundary scattering. The presented method readily lends itself to fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures in both ambient and controlled atmospheres, while the ability to assemble pre-patterned layers paves the way for complex three-dimensional architectures.},

Here we examine both intrinsic and extrinsic disorder in two-dimensional (2D) materials, in particular graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Minimizing disorder is crucial for realizing desired properties in 2D materials and improving device performance and repeatability for practical applications. We discuss the progress in disorder control for graphene and TMDs, as well as in van der Waals heterostructures realized by combining these materials with hexagonal boron nitride. Furthermore, we showcase how atomic defects or disorder can also be harnessed to provide useful electronic, optical, chemical and magnetic functions.},

In particular, the blue channel transmittance shows a large and monotonic thickness dependence, making it a very convenient probe of the flake thickness. The method proves to be robust given the small flake-to-flake variation and the insensitivity to doping changes of MoS2. We also tested the method for MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2. These results provide a reference guide to identify the number of layers of this family of materials on transparent substrates only using optical microscopy.},

In the present work, various properties of poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) exposed to heat and gamma rays in air are instrumentally investigated. If PEEK is aged by heat and gamma irradiation in air, chemical bond scission, oxidation, crosslinking, and char formation occur as competing mechanisms. The temperature plays a decisive role in degradation, while the irradiation accelerates it. The mechanical properties deteriorate much earlier than the dielectric properties with the progress of aging. This means that the mechanical properties can be an important condition monitoring factor compared to the dielectric properties for PEEK-insulated apparatus or cables. If PEEK is aged severely, its electrical conductivity increases dramatically, whereas both real and imaginary parts of complex dielectric permittivity decrease, showing a marked contrast to many industrially important polymeric insulating materials.},

It is,\_ in fact, an attempt to give a comprehensive survey oi the simpler types of design at present available, and a description of the appropriate methods of analysis.

Fisher's Design of Experiments, where he will find a full account of the logical basis of the whole technique of modern experimental design.},

In fact, they have made it possible to fabricate van der Waals heterostructures and 2D materials-based devices with complex architectures. Nonetheless, as far as we know, the number of existing papers providing enough details to reproduce these systems by other research groups is very scarce in the literature. Moreover, these systems typically require the use of expensive optical and mechanical components hampering their applicability in research groups with a low budget. Here, we demonstrate how a deterministic placement system for 2D materials, set up with full capabilities, can be implemented for under 900 € -- which can be easily implemented in labs and educational labs with low budgets.},
